This project involves an in-depth exploration of global COVID-19 data using SQL for data analysis and Tableau for interactive data visualization. The primary goal was to identify key trends, regional patterns, and make insightful forecasts about the pandemic's spread, recoveries, and fatalities.

Key Features
Data Sourcing and Cleaning: The dataset was sourced from a reliable COVID-19 data repository. SQL queries were used to clean, filter, and preprocess the data for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Key metrics such as daily cases, recoveries, and fatalities were calculated and analyzed for different regions.
Data Visualization: Using Tableau, I developed an interactive dashboard that visualizes crucial trends, including:
Infection rates and recovery patterns over time
Geographical heatmaps of case distributions
Forecasting trends based on historical data
Insights: The dashboard offers a comprehensive view of the pandemicâ€™s progression across regions, providing actionable insights and data-driven recommendations.
Technologies Used
SQL: For data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation of COVID-19 datasets.
Tableau: For building an interactive, user-friendly dashboard that visualizes the findings.
Data Sources: [Mention any specific datasets you used, like Johns Hopkins or public government data sources.]
How to Use
SQL Scripts: The SQL scripts used for data extraction and cleaning can be found in the SQL folder of the repository.
Tableau Dashboard: A link to the published Tableau dashboard is available in the Dashboard folder, or you can view it here.
Key Insights from the Project
The dashboard highlights significant spikes in cases during certain time periods and provides region-specific insights.
It also forecasts potential future trends based on past data, offering valuable information for decision-makers.
